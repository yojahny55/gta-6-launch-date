## Implementation Deep Dive

### Weighted Algorithm Specification

**Selected Approach: Hybrid Reasonable Range (Option C)**

**Weight Rules:**
- **Reasonable Range (2025-2030):** weight = 1.0 (full influence on median)
- **Outside but < 50 years:** weight = 0.3 (reduced influence)
- **Beyond 50 years:** weight = 0.1 (minimal influence, still counted and displayed)

**Calculation Method:**
1. Collect all predictions with their calculated weights
2. Sort predictions by date
3. Calculate weighted median: Find date where cumulative weight = 50% of total weight
4. Display: weighted median, actual min, actual max, total predictions

**User Transparency:**
- Disclaimer: "Extreme predictions have reduced influence on community median"
- Maintains democratic principle while protecting data integrity

### UI/UX Design

**Landing Page Flow:**
- Clear headline: GTA 6 Launch Date Tracker
- Official date display: "Rockstar says: November 19, 2026"
- Simple date picker for prediction
- Prominent submit button
- Real-time community stats: median, min, max, total count
- Optional chart toggle (default hidden)

**Post-Submission Experience:**
- Confirmation with user's prediction
- Social comparison: "You're [optimistic/pessimistic] compared to community"
- Delta from median: "[X days earlier/later] than community"
- Share buttons with pre-filled engaging text
- Embed widget code
- Optional email signup for notifications

# Implementation Sequencing

**Week 1: Core Product**
- Days 1-2: Epic 1 (Foundation)
- Days 2-5: Epic 2 (Prediction Engine)
- Days 5-7: Epic 3 (Results Display)

**Week 2: Distribution & Polish**
- Days 8-9: Epic 4 (Privacy & Compliance)
- Days 9-10: Epic 5 (Social Sharing)
- Days 10-11: Epic 6 (Widget)
- Days 11-12: Epic 7 (Accessibility & i18n)
- Days 12-13: Epic 8 (Monetization & Analytics)
- Days 13-14: Epic 9 (QA & Launch)

**Rationale:**
1. Foundation enables everything else
2. Core value (predict + display) proves concept
3. Compliance before distribution (avoid Reddit removal)
4. Distribution mechanisms together (viral growth)
5. Polish ensures quality experience
6. QA validates entire system before launch

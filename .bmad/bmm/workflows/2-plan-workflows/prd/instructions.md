<action>Welcome {user_name} and begin comprehensive discovery, and then start to GATHER ALL CONTEXT:
1. Check workflow-status.yaml for project_context (if exists)
2. Review loaded content: {product_brief_content}, {research_content}, {document_project_content} (auto-loaded in Step 0.5)
3. Detect project type AND domain complexity

Load references:
{installed_path}/project-types.csv
{installed_path}/domain-complexity.csv

Through natural conversation:
"Tell me about what you want to build - what problem does it solve and for whom?"

DUAL DETECTION:
Project type signals: API, mobile, web, CLI, SDK, SaaS
Domain complexity signals: medical, finance, government, education, aerospace

SPECIAL ROUTING:
If game detected → Inform user that game development requires the BMGD module (BMad Game Development)
If complex domain detected → Offer domain research options:
A) Run domain-research workflow (thorough)
B) Quick web search (basic)
C) User provides context
D) Continue with general knowledge

IDENTIFY WHAT MAKES IT SPECIAL early with questions such as: "What excites you most about this product?", "What would make users love this?", "What's the unique value or compelling moment?"

This becomes a thread that connects throughout the PRD.</action>

- NOT: "99.9% uptime"

The Scoping Game:

2. "What makes it competitive?" → Growth
3. "What's the dream version?" → Vision

Challenge scope creep conversationally:

<step n="8" goal="Functional Requirements Synthesis">
<critical>This section is THE CAPABILITY CONTRACT for all downstream work</critical>
<critical>UX designers will ONLY design what's listed here</critical>
<critical>Architects will ONLY support what's listed here</critical>
<critical>Epic breakdown will ONLY implement what's listed here</critical>
<critical>If a capability is missing from FRs, it will NOT exist in the final product</critical>

<action>Before writing FRs, understand their PURPOSE and USAGE:

**Purpose:**
FRs define WHAT capabilities the product must have. They are the complete inventory
of user-facing and system capabilities that deliver the product vision.

**How They Will Be Used:**

1. UX Designer reads FRs → designs interactions for each capability
2. Architect reads FRs → designs systems to support each capability
3. PM reads FRs → creates epics and stories to implement each capability
4. Dev Agent reads assembled context → implements stories based on FRs

**Critical Property - COMPLETENESS:**
Every capability discussed in vision, scope, domain requirements, and project-specific
sections MUST be represented as an FR. Missing FRs = missing capabilities.

**Critical Property - ALTITUDE:**
FRs state WHAT capability exists and WHO it serves, NOT HOW it's implemented or
specific UI/UX details. Those come later from UX and Architecture.
</action>

<action>Transform everything discovered into comprehensive functional requirements:

**Coverage - Pull from EVERYWHERE:**

- Core features from MVP scope → FRs
- Growth features → FRs (marked as post-MVP if needed)
- Domain-mandated features → FRs
- Project-type specific needs → FRs
- Innovation requirements → FRs
- Anti-patterns (explicitly NOT doing) → Note in FR section if needed

**Organization - Group by CAPABILITY AREA:**
Don't organize by technology or layer. Group by what users/system can DO:

- ✅ "User Management" (not "Authentication System")
- ✅ "Content Discovery" (not "Search Algorithm")
- ✅ "Team Collaboration" (not "WebSocket Infrastructure")

**Format - Flat, Numbered List:**
Each FR is one clear capability statement:

- FR#: [Actor] can [capability] [context/constraint if needed]
- Number sequentially (FR1, FR2, FR3...)
- Aim for 20-50 FRs for typical projects (fewer for simple, more for complex)

**Altitude Check:**
Each FR should answer "WHAT capability exists?" NOT "HOW is it implemented?"

- ✅ "Users can customize appearance settings"
- ❌ "Users can toggle light/dark theme with 3 font size options stored in LocalStorage"

The second example belongs in Epic Breakdown, not PRD.
</action>

<example>
**Well-written FRs at the correct altitude:**

**User Account & Access:**

- FR1: Users can create accounts with email or social authentication
- FR2: Users can log in securely and maintain sessions across devices
- FR3: Users can reset passwords via email verification
- FR4: Users can update profile information and preferences
- FR5: Administrators can manage user roles and permissions

**Content Management:**

- FR6: Users can create, edit, and delete content items
- FR7: Users can organize content with tags and categories
- FR8: Users can search content by keyword, tag, or date range
- FR9: Users can export content in multiple formats

**Data Ownership (local-first products):**

- FR10: All user data stored locally on user's device
- FR11: Users can export complete data at any time
- FR12: Users can import previously exported data
- FR13: System monitors storage usage and warns before limits

**Collaboration:**

- FR14: Users can share content with specific users or teams
- FR15: Users can comment on shared content
- FR16: Users can track content change history
- FR17: Users receive notifications for relevant updates

**Notice:**
✅ Each FR is a testable capability
✅ Each FR is implementation-agnostic (could be built many ways)
✅ Each FR specifies WHO and WHAT, not HOW
✅ No UI details, no performance numbers, no technology choices
✅ Comprehensive coverage of capability areas
</example>

<action>Generate the complete FR list by systematically extracting capabilities:

1. MVP scope → extract all capabilities → write as FRs
2. Growth features → extract capabilities → write as FRs (note if post-MVP)
3. Domain requirements → extract mandatory capabilities → write as FRs
4. Project-type specifics → extract type-specific capabilities → write as FRs
5. Innovation patterns → extract novel capabilities → write as FRs

Organize FRs by logical capability groups (5-8 groups typically).
Number sequentially across all groups (FR1, FR2... FR47).
</action>

<action>SELF-VALIDATION - Before finalizing, ask yourself:

**Completeness Check:**

1. "Did I cover EVERY capability mentioned in the MVP scope section?"
2. "Did I include domain-specific requirements as FRs?"
3. "Did I cover the project-type specific needs (API/Mobile/SaaS/etc)?"
4. "Could a UX designer read ONLY the FRs and know what to design?"
5. "Could an Architect read ONLY the FRs and know what to support?"
6. "Are there any user actions or system behaviors we discussed that have no FR?"

**Altitude Check:**

1. "Am I stating capabilities (WHAT) or implementation (HOW)?"
2. "Am I listing acceptance criteria or UI specifics?" (Remove if yes)
3. "Could this FR be implemented 5 different ways?" (Good - means it's not prescriptive)

**Quality Check:**

1. "Is each FR clear enough that someone could test whether it exists?"
2. "Is each FR independent (not dependent on reading other FRs to understand)?"
3. "Did I avoid vague terms like 'good', 'fast', 'easy'?" (Use NFRs for quality attributes)

COMPLETENESS GATE: Review your FR list against the entire PRD written so far.

2. **UX Design** (If UI exists)
